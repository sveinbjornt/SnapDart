# SnapTools

**SnapTools is currently a work in progress**

SnapTools is a collection of tools that integrate aspects of the macOS GUI 
with the UNIX command line interface.

<!--* [Download SnapTools 1.0]() (Intel 64-bit, 10.8 or later, ~0.5 MB) -->

SnapTools contains the following programs:

* **Snap.app** - shows window with a list of files fed in from command line
* **snap** - open a window in Snap.app with file(s)
* **comment** - set or show file's Finder/Spotlight comment
* **copy** - copy file representation(s) to the clipboard
* **getinfo** - show Finder's "Get Info" window for files(s)
* **label** - set or print file labels
* **move** - tell Finder to move file(s)
* **paths** - show all paths in input
* **show** - show file(s) in the Finder
* **trash** - move file(s) to the Trash

Together, they make interaction between the window environment and command line
a great deal easier.
